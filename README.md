# OralCancerDetection
The project uses Python and CNNs to detect oral cancer from medical images at an early stage. It classifies images as normal or cancerous, helping doctors with faster, more accurate diagnosis. This AI-driven approach reduces diagnostic time and can be adapted for other medical image detection tasks.
